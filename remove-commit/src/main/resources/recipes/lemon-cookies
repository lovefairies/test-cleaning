                                     In a large mixing bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
                                     In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or a large mixing bowl using a hand-held mixer, beat the butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add in the egg and mix until well combined. Add in the lemon zest, lemon juice, lemon extract, and yellow food coloring (if using, I just used 2-3 drops) and mix well, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
                                     Slowly add in the dry ingredients and mix until just combined
                                     Cover tightly and transfer to the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to chill the cookie dough.
                                     Preheat oven to 350°F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
                                     Remove the cookie dough from the refrigerator and scoop out two tablespoon sized pieces of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets. I prefer to roll the dough into balls and then gently press them down a little.
                                     Bake in batches at 350°F for 10-12 minutes. The cookies should look done on the outside, but still a little soft on the inside. Remove from the oven and cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling.
